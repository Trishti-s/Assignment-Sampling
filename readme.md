 ## Title : Sampling Techniques and Model Comparison on Imbalanced Dataset

## Methodology
Data Loading → Data Preprocessing → Sampling Techniques → Model Training → Model Evaluation → Performance Comparison → Best Model Selection


## Sampling Techniques Used
1. Random Sampling
2. Systematic Sampling
3. Stratified Sampling
4. Bootstrapping
5. Cross Validation

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Input
- Credit-card-like dataset with numerical features
- Binary target variable (Class 0 and Class 1)

## Output
- Model accuracy
- Comparison table of sampling vs models
- Visualization of performance
- Identification of best sampling-model combination
